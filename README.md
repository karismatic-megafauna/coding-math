### All the code for the examples I have done lives here:
https://coding-math.herokuapp.com/

### His website with all the videos
www.codingmath.com

This is a repo that explores these amazing videos
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF6F8LdCSWlRwQm_hfA2bcQ

It is written in ES6 and has tests!

If you just want to get going and not set up all that madness, checkout the
repo online for coding math:

## TODO's
Add redux!
It would be great to have some sort of state management for key presses
or maybe the beginnings of saving user state for a video game! Need to
watch the ballistics video to see where this might be applicable :)
